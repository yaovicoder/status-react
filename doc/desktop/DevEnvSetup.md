# Development environment setup

## Prerequisites

lein, node.js v.8, cmake, Qt 5.9.1 (with QtWebEngine components installed), Qt's qmake available in PATH. If building on Ubuntu newer than 16.10, then Qt 5.10.1 is recommended (although not fully tested).

Note: add qmake to PATH via

- On MacOS: `export PATH=<QT_PATH>/clang_64/bin:$PATH`
- On Linux: `export PATH=<QT_PATH>/gcc_64/bin:$PATH`

Caveats:

- If npm hangs at some step, check the version. If it's 5.6.0 or higher, try downgrading to 5.5.1 via `npm install -g npm@5.5.1`

## To install react-native-cli with desktop commands support

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/status-im/react-native-desktop.git
cd react-native-desktop/react-native-cli
npm update
npm install -g
```

## To setup re-natal dev builds of status-react for Desktop

1. Run the following commands:
    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/status-im/status-react.git
    cd status-react
    make prepare-desktop
    ln -sf './node_modules/re-natal/index.js' './re-natal'
    ./re-natal use-figwheel
    ./re-natal enable-source-maps
    ```
1. In separate terminal tab: `npm start` (note: it starts react-native packager )
1. In separate terminal tab: `node ./ubuntu-server.js`
1. In separate terminal tab: `lein figwheel-repl desktop` (note: wait until sources are compiled)
1. In separate terminal tab: `react-native run-desktop`

## Editor setup

Running `lein figwheel-repl desktop` will run a REPL on port 7888 by default. Some additional steps might be needed to connect to it.

### emacs-cider

In order to get REPL working, use the below elisp code:

``` clojure
(defun custom-cider-jack-in ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((status-desktop-params "with-profile +figwheel repl"))
    (set-variable 'cider-lein-parameters status-desktop-params)
    (message "setting 'cider-lein-parameters")
    (cider-jack-in)))

(defun start-figwheel-cljs-repl ()
  (interactive)
  (set-buffer "*cider-repl status-react*")
  (goto-char (point-max))
  (insert "(do (use 'figwheel-api)
           (start [:desktop])
           (start-cljs-repl))")
  (cider-repl-return))
```

`custom-cider-jack-in` sets the correct profile for leiningen, and can be run as soon as emacs is open.
run `start-figwheel-cljs-repl` once you already have a cider repl session from the jack-in

### vim-fireplace

For some reason there is no `.nrepl-port` file in project root, so `vim-fireplace` will not be able to connect automatically. You can either:

- run `:Connect` and answer a couple of interactive prompts
- create `.nrepl-port` file manually and add a single line containing `7888` (or whatever port REPL is running on)

After Figwheel has connected to the app, run the following command inside Vim, and you should be all set:

``` clojure
:Piggieback (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/repl-env)
```
